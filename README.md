<h3 align="center">Engineering Toolbox Dashboard<!-- Serve Confidently --></h3>
<p align="center">This is a custom dashboard that I built to centralize information, tools and links that I use on a daily basis</p>

This project uses **open-source** software to deliver a simple and elegant dashboard solution.

This a work project that has become a personal project for managing content for my daily engineering work at the office.

It aims to combine commonly used engineering calculations, tools, links to resources and exposure to daily media updates in the automotive engineering and tech realms.
